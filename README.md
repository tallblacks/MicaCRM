# MicaCRM
This CRM system was developed for Mica and her team.

The development of the system was rushed, completed in early 2014, and did not utilize any PHP framework. The system was built using PHP and MariaDB, with Apache serving as the web server. Initially, the system was deployed on CentOS. In late December 2023, due to the expiration of the cloud service provider's servers and considerations such as Red Hat's withdrawal of support for CentOS, it was migrated to Ubuntu.

The system supports various roles, including administrators, customer service, super customer service, business, and agents, each with specific permissions. It accommodates both individual and group purchases by customers, and features intricate profit and revenue-sharing calculations. The system can display different product prices and profits based on the user's role and allows for the export of user orders. Convenient query functionalities are provided.

There have been multiple intentions to rewrite the system using web frameworks in PHP, Python, or JS. However, due to time constraints, these initiatives were not launched. The current system will not undergo further modifications. If Mica and her team have updated business requirements in the future, a consideration could be given to rewriting a new system using MERN.
